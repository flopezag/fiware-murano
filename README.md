## Introduction

This is the code repository for **FIWARE Application Manager GE - Murano**, FIWARE Cloud implementations of the OpenStack Murano components with docker. We are working directly over OpenStack Community so the information that we keep here is specific to the FIWARE implementation. The rest can be found in the OpenStack Community directly.

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://www.fiware.org). Check also the [FIWARE Catalogue entry for Murano](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/application-management-murano)

Any feedback on this documentation is highly welcome, including bugs, typos
or things you think should be included but aren't. You can use [github issues](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-murano/issues/new) to provide feedback.

## GEi overall description
The Murano Project introduces an application catalog to OpenStack, enabling application developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready applications in a browsable categorized catalog. Cloud users -- including inexperienced ones -- can then use the catalog to compose reliable application environments with the push of a button.

The key goal is to provide UI and API which allows to compose and deploy composite environments on the Application abstraction level and then manage their lifecycle. The Service should be able to orchestrate complex circular dependent cases in order to setup complete environments with many dependent applications and services. However, the actual deployment itself will be done by the existing software orchestration tools (such as Heat), while the Murano project will become an integration point for various applications and services.

For latest releases of Murano please refer to [OpenStack releases](http://releases.openstack.org) For release notes of Murano projects please refer to release note pages for [murano](http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/murano/index.html), [murano-dashboard](http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/murano-dashboard/index.html), [python-muranoclient](http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/python-muranoclient/index.html), and [murano-agent](http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/murano-agent/index.html). 

FIWARE Murano, keep the specific configuration of OpenStack Murano to be applied in FIWARA Lab environment besides with the docker file to use Murano with dockers.

## Testing

### Unit tests
Murano has a suite of tests that are run on all submitted code, and it is recommended that developers execute the tests themselves to catch regressions early. Developers are also expected to keep the test suite up-to-date with any submitted code changes. See [Murano Unit Tests](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/murano/guidelines.html#testing-guidelines) for more details.

### End-to-end tests
All Murano services have tempest-based automated tests, which allow to verify API interfaces and deployment scenarios. See [Murano automated tests tempest tests](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/murano/articles/test_docs.html#murano-automated-tests-tempest-tests) for more details.
